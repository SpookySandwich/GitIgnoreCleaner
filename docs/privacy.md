# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** October 26, 2023

GitIgnoreCleaner ("the Application") is a desktop utility designed to help users clean build artifacts and temporary files based on `.gitignore` rules. This Privacy Policy describes how the Application handles your data.

## Data Collection and Usage

**GitIgnoreCleaner does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.**

- **Local Processing:** All file scanning, analysis, and deletion operations are performed locally on your device. No file names, paths, or contents are sent to any external server.
- **No Telemetry:** The Application does not include any analytics, tracking, or telemetry mechanisms.
- **No Account Required:** You do not need to create an account or provide any personal information to use the Application.

## File System Access

The Application requires access to the file system to function. This access is used solely for:
1.  Scanning directories you select to identify files matching your ignore rules.
2.  Deleting files and folders that you explicitly select for removal.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
